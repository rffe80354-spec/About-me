# About-me
# ⚡ Yaroslav Perets | Lead AI Architect & Full-Stack Engineer

**`INTJ-A` | `Asynchronous Deep Work` | `AI-Native Velocity (x3)`**

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer and System Architect specializing in LLM orchestration, scalable backend systems, and automated workflows. By utilizing advanced AI tooling (Cursor + Claude 4.6), I deliver production-ready code and architecture at 3x the velocity of traditional workflows.

### 🏗️ Current Focus: CourseSmith AI (Private SaaS)
Currently Lead Product Developer & Architect for **CourseSmith AI**, an advanced EdTech SaaS platform. 
* **Architecture:** Node.js/TypeScript, Python, React Native.
* **Security:** Custom Middleware Proxies (Render) for LLM API Key protection, HWID Licensing via Whop API.
* **Database:** Supabase (Auth/RLS/Storage), PostgreSQL.
* *Note: The repository is currently private as it is a commercial product in active development.*

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Ecosystem:** `Node.js`, `Python`, `React/Next.js`, `PHP (Laravel)`
* **AI & Data:** `LLM Orchestration`, `RAG Pipelines`, `Vector DBs`
* **Infrastructure:** `Supabase`, `Docker`, `CI/CD`, `Redis`

📫 **Communication Protocol:** I operate strictly on an Asynchronous text-based communication protocol to ensure zero micromanagement and maximum deep-work efficiency.
